        "description": "Climate change is not just a distant threat—it is already reshaping ecosystems, economies, and communities across the globe. From the melting polar ice caps and rising sea levels threatening coastal cities, to the devastating wildfires and droughts endangering agriculture and livelihoods, the impacts of climate change are undeniable and escalating. As we approach what many scientists warn could be a \"point of no return,\" this debate invites you to critically examine the adequacy of current global policies and actions aimed at addressing this crisis. Are the international agreements like the Paris Accord enough, or do we need more radical, immediate measures? How can we ensure that the transition to a sustainable future is equitable and just, leaving no one behind? In this debate, we will explore not only the scientific and environmental aspects but also the ethical, economic, and political challenges. Join us in discussing the most pressing issue of our time, and let's find a way forward together.",

        "description": "Economic inequality is more than just a statistic; it is a daily reality for billions of people who struggle to access basic needs like healthcare, education, and housing. The growing gap between the wealthy elite and the rest of the population has far-reaching consequences, from social unrest to the weakening of democratic institutions. In this debate, we will explore a range of potential economic reforms—such as progressive taxation, universal basic income, and wealth redistribution—that could help bridge the global gap. But how do we balance these reforms with economic growth, and what role should international organizations play in ensuring fair economic practices? Join us as we dissect the causes and solutions for one of the most pressing challenges of our time.",
